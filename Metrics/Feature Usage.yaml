### ============= STANDARD PRE-PROCESSING =============
# SETUP run context, and skip duplicate CREATE vt_* statements :
{% set run = namespace(completed=[], variables={}) if run is not defined else run %}
### Macro imported below will validate /correct a subset of variables,
### then export ALL variables to a reconcile_variables.csv
### Hence, this process must run AFTER the "tasks:" node
{% import "coa_util.j2" as macro with context %}
{{ macro.validate_variables(run) }}
### return corrected variables to the main namespace:

{% set your_name     = run.variables['your_name']     %}
