  Generate data required to perform graph analysis on joins between all the
  tables or databases on the system.   Currently this generates the volatile table
  and csv file, but doesn't generate the graph (yet).  To switch the graph level
  between table and database, set the variable 'graph_level' to either 'table'
  or 'database'.  Default is 'table'.
