High-level instructions:
------------------------

1) Unzip the attached file into a directory of your choosing.

2) Confirm you have full access to all files by navigating to the unzipped folder.
   If you need help with granting permission:
     - Linux/MacOS, run in a terminal:   chmod 755 *
     - Windows: highlight all files, and follow these instructions:
       https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc754344(v=ws.11)?redirectedfrom=MSDN

   Note, if you do not have full permissions to all files, results may only partially load

3) Locate the "login.bteq" file and update with the appropriate credentials

4) Execute the file "RUNME.bteq" using BTEQ, typically with the commandline: ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
     bteq <RUNME.bteq 1>RUNLOG.txt 2>RUNERROR.txt

5) Upon completion of the script, verify the RUNERROR.txt is empty / zero-byte file
     If there were errors that are not easily remedied (i.e., bad credentials),
     reach out to your Teradata contact for help, sending both RUN*.txt files

6) Zip up the entire directory, data and logs together, and return to your Teradata contact.

------------------------

If you have questions at any point, please reach out to your Teradata contact or CSM.

Thank you again!
