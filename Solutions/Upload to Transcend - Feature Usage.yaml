### ============= STANDARD PRE-PROCESSING =============
# SETUP run context, and skip duplicate CREATE vt_* statements :
{% set run = namespace(completed=[], variables={}) if run is not defined else run %}
### Macro imported below will validate /correct a subset of variables,
### then export ALL variables to a reconcile_variables.csv
### Hence, this process must run AFTER the "tasks:" node
{% import "coa_util.j2" as macro with context %}
{{ macro.validate_variables(run) }}
### return corrected variables to the main namespace:
{% set startdate     = run.variables['startdate']     %}
{% set enddate       = run.variables['enddate']       %}
{% set your_name     = run.variables['your_name']     %}
{% set your_title    = run.variables['your_title']    %}
{% set customer_name = run.variables['customer_name'] %}
{% set tdver = run.variables['tdver'] %}{% set td15 = run.variables['td15'] %}
{% set td16 = run.variables['td16'] %}{% set td17 = run.variables['td17'] %}
