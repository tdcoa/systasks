  This demonstrated COA charting of HEATMAPS in action, from pulling data through generating
  the final graph.

### ============= STANDARD PRE-PROCESSING =============
# SETUP run context, and skip duplicate CREATE vt_* statements :
{% set run = namespace(completed=[], dates=[]) if run is not defined else run %}
### import macro to harden start/end dates:
{% import "coa_util.j2" as macro with context %}
{{ macro.harden_dates(run, startdate, enddate) }}
{% set startdate = run.dates[0] %}
{% set enddate = run.dates[1] %}
