  This is as "hello world" as it comes -- Three basic selects:
  the first from dbc.info, which will return a .csv, the second from the
  calendar table with a random number generator, which is saved to both a .csv
  and a graph.  All save output to the defined "Out" directory.


tasks:

# SQL can be placed inline, as shown here:
- name: Export contents of dbc.info
  connect: source  # connect to "source system" as specified
  export:
    file: dbcinfo.csv   # save output to this file
    sql:  Select * from dbc.dbcinfo


# SQL can be placed inline with newlines, by adding a single pipe up front.
# This tells yaml to pick up SQL content in the subsequent lines.
# Note, the indenting from the "sql:" name must be maintained.  The first line
# that has a lesser indent signifies the next statement.
- name: Export random number by date
  connect: source
  export:
    file: random1.csv
    sql: |
      select
       calendar_date as LogDate
      ,random(10,100) as random_value1
      ,random_value1 + random(-10,30) as random_value2
      from sys_calendar.calendar
      where LogDate between {{ startdate }} and {{ enddate }}


# SQL can also be placed in a separate file, using the "sqlfile" attribute.
# also, if you have special characters (as in the name below) you should
# wrap the entire name in double-quotes:
- name: "Export contents: sql/random.sql file"
  connect: source
  export:
    file: random2.csv
    sqlfile:  sql/random.sql
