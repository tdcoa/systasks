  Demonstrate how to include work from other metrics.  This is done
  via the popular Jinja Template Engine.  While it is primarily used
  in python web applications like Django and Flask, or in Networking
  applications like Ansible, it is generic, and works quite well for
  advanced parameterizing of SQL within COA.

### ============= STANDARD PRE-PROCESSING =============
# SETUP run context, and skip duplicate CREATE vt_* statements :
{% set run = namespace(completed=[], dates=[]) if run is not defined else run %}
### import macro to harden start/end dates:
{% import "coa_util.j2" as macro with context %}
{{ macro.harden_dates(run, startdate, enddate) }}
{% set startdate = run.dates[0] %}
{% set enddate = run.dates[1] %}

tasks:

# The Include command points to other files, and plug the content of
# that file over the top of the Jinja include statement.
# It can be thought of as "copy/paste that document right here" at
# runtime.  This means you have to pay attention to details on
# where it is placed, i.e., how it is indented, etc.

# For COA, all templates are designed to fit on their own lines,
# with no indenting, for simplicity.

# Let's build several Dimension tables:
{% include 'vt_decode_statement.j2' %}
{% include 'vt_decode_app.j2' %}
{% include 'vt_decode_user.j2' %}

# Let's also calculate concurrency:
{% include 'vt_concurrency.j2' %}

# at this point, we now have 5 volatile tables created in the session,
#  - 1 containing Concurrency
#  - 3 for the Dimensions we asked for
#  - 1 more Dimension (vt_dim_tdinternal_databases) that was required by vt_dim_user

# The last dimension table was created as a dependency for vt_dim_user
# and illustrates the ability to nest dependencies.

# These templates only create the volatile table, they don't
# actually DO anything with that data - that's where the calling
# solution comes in.  For instance:

- name: Export vt_concurrency for charting
  connect: source
  export:
    file: concurrency.csv
    sql: |
      select LogDate
      ,Avg(Concurrency_Avg) as "Average--#10890A"
      ,Avg(Concurrency_80Pctl) as "80th Percentile--#9C9700"
      ,Avg(Concurrency_95Pctl) as "95th Percentile--#7E0606"
      ,MAX(Concurrency_Peak) as "Absolute Peak--#FF0000"
      from vt_concurrency
      group by 1
      order by 1

# By convension, the vt_TableName and template file name are consistently named
# for ease of use.  For example, the template: vt_concurrency.j2 above will
# create a vt_concurrency table.

- name: Chart Concurrency
  chart:
    command: chart/line_xDate_yElse.py
    params:
      - "file:concurrency.csv"
      - "title:Concurrency - {{ siteid }}"
      - "height:6"
      - "width:12"

# If you are running large projects, or have small spool space allocations, you
# may want to drop vt_ after you are done using them.  They are volatile tables,
# so this is optional - all will be destroyed at the end of your session.
