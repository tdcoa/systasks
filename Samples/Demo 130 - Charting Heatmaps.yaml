  This demonstrated COA charting of HEATMAPS in action, from pulling data through generating
  the final graph.


tasks:

# generate cpu data per day / hour:
{% set logts = true %}
{% include "vt_system_cpu_by_day.j2" %}

# extract data from VT, keeping only data we want to graph, with appropriate names:
- name: Export CPU% by Date and Hour
  connect: source
  export:
