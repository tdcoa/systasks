  Demonstrate calling / using the coa_util.j2 macro template.

tasks:
{% set run = namespace(completed=[]) if run is not defined else run %}


### you can import & call macros (generic, atomic peices of work)
### from other files to speed work and reduce complexity.
### for example, let's import a macro from the "coa_util" file:
{% import "coa_util.j2" as macro with context %}
{{ macro.build_include_flags(run, ['Defaults','LogDate']) }}

### The build_include_flags macro will evaluate the various "include" variables
### and create an "included" list for all metrics that qualify (used in DBQL_Core).
### There are 2 parms: the namespace (run) and any defaults to always include.
### This allows for a quick check later in code by looking for:

{% if 'LogDate' in run.included %}
- name: Do some DATE-specific work here
  connect: source
  execute:
    sql: Select 'LogDate' as SomeProcess
{% endif %}

{% if 'UserName' in run.included %}
- name: Do some user-specific work here
  connect: source
  execute:
    sql: Select 'UserName' as SomeProcess
{% else %}
- name: "To do user-specific work, include_user = true"
  connect: source
  execute:
    sql: |
      Select 'Add variable include_user = true' as option1
             'Add variable include = "user, other includes, etc"' as option2
{% endif %}


- name: Print out all included variables
  connect: source
  execute:
    sql: |
      Select 'All included columns' as header
      {% for incl in run.included %}
       ,'Included: {{incl}}' as {{incl}}
      {% endfor %}


### Calling the macro again will re-run the logic, potentially overwriting results
{{ macro.build_include_flags(run, ['LogDate']) }}  # removed 'Defaults'

- name: Print out all included variables (after macro rerun)
  connect: source
  execute:
    sql: |
      Select 'All included columns' as header
      {% for incl in run.included %}
       ,'Included: {{incl}}' as {{incl}}
      {% endfor %}
