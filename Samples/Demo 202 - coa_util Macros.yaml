  Demonstrate calling / using the coa_util.j2 macro template.

### ============= STANDARD PRE-PROCESSING =============
# SETUP run context, and skip duplicate CREATE vt_* statements :
{% set run = namespace(completed=[], dates=[]) if run is not defined else run %}
### import macro to harden start/end dates:
{% import "coa_util.j2" as macro with context %}
{{ macro.harden_dates(run, startdate, enddate) }}
{% set startdate = run.dates[0] %}
{% set enddate = run.dates[1] %}
### ============= STANDARD PRE-PROCESSING =============


tasks:


### you can import & call macros (generic, atomic peices of work)
### from other files to speed work and reduce complexity.
### for example, let's import a macro from the "coa_util" file:
{% import "coa_util.j2" as macro with context %}
{{ macro.build_include_flags(run, ['Defaults','LogDate']) }}

### The build_include_flags macro will evaluate the various "include" variables
### and create an "included" list for all metrics that qualify (used in DBQL_Core).
### There are 2 parms: the namespace (run) and any defaults to always include.
### This allows for a quick check later in code by looking for:

{% if 'LogDate' in run.included %}
- name: Do some DATE-specific work here
  connect: source
  execute:
    sql: Select 'LogDate' as SomeProcess
{% endif %}

{% if 'UserName' in run.included %}
- name: Do some user-specific work here
  connect: source
  execute:
    sql: Select 'UserName' as SomeProcess
{% else %}
- name: "To do NON-user-specific work"
  connect: source
  execute:
    sql: |
      Select 'Non-User Work' as SomeProcess
{% endif %}


- name: Print out all included variables
  connect: source
  execute:
    sql: |
      Select 'All included columns' as header
      {% for incl in run.included %}
       ,'Included: {{incl}}' as {{incl}}
      {% endfor %}


### Calling the macro again will re-run the logic, potentially overwriting results
{{ macro.build_include_flags(run, ['LogDate']) }}  # removed 'Defaults'

- name: Print out all included variables (after macro rerun)
  connect: source
  execute:
    sql: |
      Select 'All included columns' as header
      {% for incl in run.included %}
       ,'Included: {{incl}}' as {{incl}}
      {% endfor %}
